<h2>A first approximation to Random Effects Exploratory Factor Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Inspired, in part, by the wprifm function in the profileR package, fa.random removes between subject differences in mean level and then does a normal exploratory factor analysis of the ipsatized data.  Functionally, this removes a general factor of the data before factoring. To prevent non-positive definiteness of the residual data matrix, a very small amount of random noise is added to each variable. This is just a call to fa after removing the between subjects effect. Read the help file for <code><a href="fa.html">fa</a></code> for a detailed explanation of all of the input parameters and the output objects. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
fa.random(data, nfactors = 1, fix = TRUE, n.obs = NA, n.iter = 1, rotate = "oblimin",
 scores = "regression", residuals = FALSE, SMC = TRUE, covar = FALSE, missing = FALSE,  
 impute = "median", min.err = 0.001, max.iter = 50, symmetric = TRUE, warnings = TRUE,
  fm = "minres", alpha = 0.1, p = 0.05, oblique.scores = FALSE, np.obs = NULL, 
  use = "pairwise", cor = "cor", weight = NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A raw data matrix (or data.frame)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nfactors</code></td>
<td>
<p> Number of factors to extract, default is 1 </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fix</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, then a small amount of random error is added to each observed variable to keep the matrix positive semi-definite.  If FALSE, then this is not done but because the matrix is non-positive semi-definite it will need to be smoothed when finding the scores and the various statistics.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of observations used to find the correlation matrix if using a correlation matrix.  Used for finding the goodness of fit statistics. Must be specified if using a correlaton matrix and finding confidence intervals. Ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>np.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pairwise number of observations. Used if using a correlation matrix and asking for a minchi solution.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rotate</code></td>
<td>
<p>&quot;none&quot;, &quot;varimax&quot;, &quot;quartimax&quot;,  &quot;bentlerT&quot;, &quot;equamax&quot;, &quot;varimin&quot;, &quot;geominT&quot; and &quot;bifactor&quot; are orthogonal rotations.  &quot;Promax&quot;, &quot;promax&quot;, &quot;oblimin&quot;, &quot;simplimax&quot;, &quot;bentlerQ,  &quot;geominQ&quot; and &quot;biquartimin&quot; and &quot;cluster&quot; are possible oblique transformations of the solution.  The default is to do a oblimin transformation, although  versions prior to 2009 defaulted to varimax. SPSS seems to do a Kaiser normalization before doing Promax, this is done here by the call to &quot;promax&quot; which does the normalization before calling Promax in GPArotation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n.iter</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of bootstrap interations to do in fa or fa.poly</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>residuals</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the residual matrix be shown </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scores</code></td>
<td>
<p>the default=&quot;regression&quot; finds factor scores using regression.  Alternatives for  estimating factor scores include simple regression (&quot;Thurstone&quot;), correlaton preserving (&quot;tenBerge&quot;) as well as &quot;Anderson&quot; and &quot;Bartlett&quot; using the appropriate algorithms ( <code><a href="factor.scores.html">factor.scores</a></code>). Although scores=&quot;tenBerge&quot; is probably preferred for most solutions, it will lead to problems with some improper correlation matrices.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>SMC</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use squared multiple correlations (SMC=TRUE) or use 1  as initial communality estimate. Try using 1 if imaginary eigen values are reported. If SMC is a vector of length the number of variables, then these values are used as starting values in the case of fm='pa'. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>covar</code></td>
<td>
<p>if covar is TRUE, factor the covariance matrix, otherwise factor the correlation matrix</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>missing</code></td>

<p>if scores are TRUE, and missing=TRUE, then impute missing values using either the median or the mean</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>impute</code></td>
<td>
<p>&quot;median&quot; or &quot;mean&quot; values are used to replace missing values</p>

<p>Iterate until the change in communalities is less than min.err</p>
</td></tr>

<p>warnings=TRUE =&gt; warn if number of factors is too many </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Factoring method  fm=&quot;minres&quot; will do a minimum residual as will fm=&quot;uls&quot;.  Both of these use a first derivative.  fm=&quot;ols&quot; differs very slightly from &quot;minres&quot; in that it minimizes the entire residual matrix using an OLS procedure but uses the empirical first derivative.  This will be slower.  fm=&quot;wls&quot; will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, fm=&quot;gls&quot; does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS), fm=&quot;pa&quot; will do the principal factor solution, fm=&quot;ml&quot; will do a maximum likelihood factor analysis. fm=&quot;minchi&quot; will minimize the sample size weighted chi square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects per pair. fm =&quot;minrank&quot; will do a minimum rank factor analysis. &quot;old.min&quot; will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April, 2017 (see discussion below).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>alpha level for the confidence intervals for RMSEA</p>
</td></tr>

<p>if doing iterations to find confidence intervals, what probability values should be found for the confidence intervals</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>oblique.scores</code></td>

<p>When factor scores are found, should they be based on the structure matrix (default) or the pattern matrix (oblique.scores=TRUE).  </p>
</td></tr> 
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>If not NULL, a vector of length n.obs that contains weights for each observation. The NULL case is equivalent to all cases being weighted 1.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is inspired by the wprifm function in the profileR package and the citation there to a paper by Davison, Kim and Close (2009).  The basic logic is to extract a means vector from each subject and then to analyze the resulting ipsatized data matrix.  This can be seen as removing acquiecence in the case of personality items, or the general factor, in the case of ability items.  Factors composed of items that are all keyed the same way (e.g., Neuroticism in the <code><a href="../../psychTools/html/bfi.html">bfi</a></code> data set) will be most affected by this technique. 
</p>
<p>The output is identical to the normal <code><a href="fa.html">fa</a></code> output with the addition of two objects:  subject and within.r.  The subject object is just the vector of the mean score for each subject on all the items. within.r is just the correlation of each item with those scores.

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>complexity</code></td>

<p>Value of the function that is minimized by a maximum likelihood procedures.  This is reported for comparison purposes and as a way to estimate chi square goodness of fit.  The objective function is 
<br />
<i>log(trace ((FF'+U2)^{-1} R) -  log(|(FF'+U2)^-1 R|) - n.items</i>. When using MLE, this function is minimized.  When using OLS (minres), although we are not minimizing this function directly, we can still calculate it in order to compare the solution to a MLE fit. </p>
</td></tr>

<p>If the number of observations is specified or found, this is a chi square based upon the objective function, f (see above). Using the formula from <code><a href="../../stats/html/factanal.html">factanal</a></code>(which seems to be Bartlett's test) :

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>chi</code></td>
<td>
<p>When normal theory fails (e.g., in the case of non-positive definite matrices), it useful to examine the empirically derived <i>chi^2</i> based upon the sum of the squared residuals * N.  This will differ slightly from the MLE estimate which is based upon the fitting function rather than the actual residuals.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rms</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the sum of the squared (off diagonal residuals) divided by the degrees of freedom.  Comparable to an RMSEA which, because it is based upon  <i>chi^2</i>, requires the number of observations to be specified.  The rms is an empirical value while the RMSEA is based upon normal theory and the non-central <i>chi^2</i> distribution. That is to say, if the residuals are particularly non-normal, the rms value and the associated  <i>chi^2</i> and RMSEA can differ substantially. </p>
</td></tr> 
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crms</code></td>
<td>
<p>rms adjusted for degrees of freedom</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RMSEA</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation is based upon the non-central 
<i>chi^2</i> distribution and the <i>chi^2</i> estimate found from the MLE fitting function.  With normal theory data, this is fine.  But when the residuals are not distributed according to a noncentral <i>chi^2</i>, this can give very strange values.  (And thus the confidence intervals can not be calculated.) The RMSEA is a conventional index of goodness (badness) of fit but it is also useful to examine the actual rms values.  </p>

<p>The correlations of the factor score estimates using the specified model, if they were to be found.  Comparing these correlations with that of the scores themselves will show, if an alternative estimate of factor scores is used (e.g., the tenBerge method), the problem of factor indeterminacy.

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scores</code></td>
<td>
<p>The factor scores as requested.  Note that these scores reflect the choice of the way scores should be estimated (see scores in the input).  That is, simple regression (&quot;Thurstone&quot;), correlaton preserving (&quot;tenBerge&quot;) as well as &quot;Anderson&quot; and &quot;Bartlett&quot; using the appropriate algorithms (see <code><a href="factor.scores.html">factor.scores</a></code>).  The correlation between factor score estimates (r.scores) is based upon using the regression/Thurstone approach.  The actual correlation between scores will reflect the rotation algorithm chosen and may be found by correlating those scores. Although the scores are found by multiplying the standarized data by the weights matrix, this will not result in standard scores if using regression. </p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>An interesting, but not necessarily good, idea. 
To see what this does if there is a general factor, consider the unrotated solutions to the ability data set. In particular, compare the first factor loading with its congruence to the ipsatized solution means vector correlated with the items (the within.r object).  </p>
