<h2>Estimate and display direct and indirect effects of mediators and  moderator in path models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the direct and indirect effects of a predictor in path models of mediation and moderation. Bootstrap confidence intervals for the indirect effects.  Mediation models are just extended regression models making explicit the effect of particular covariates in the model. Moderation is done by multiplication of the predictor variables.   This function supplies basic mediation/moderation analyses for some of the classic problem types. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
mediate(y, x, m=NULL, data, mod = NULL, z = NULL, n.obs = NULL, use = "pairwise",
 n.iter = 5000,  alpha = 0.05, std = FALSE,plot=TRUE,zero=TRUE,main="Mediation")
mediate.diagram(medi,digits=2,ylim=c(3,7),xlim=c(-1,10),show.c=TRUE,
     main="Mediation model",cex=1,l.cex=1,...)
moderate.diagram(medi,digits=2,ylim=c(2,8),main="Moderation model", cex=1,l.cex=1,...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When doing linear modeling, it is frequently convenient to estimate the direct effect of a predictor controlling for the indirect effect of a mediator.  See Preacher and Hayes (2004) for a very thorough discussion of mediation.  The mediate function will do some basic mediation and moderation models, with bootstrapped confidence intervals for the mediation/moderation effects. 
</p>
<p>Functionally, this is just regular linear regression and partial correlation with some different output.
</p>
<p>In the case of two predictor variables, X and M, and a criterion variable Y, then the direct effect of X on Y, labeled with the path c, is said to be mediated by the effect of x on M (path a) and the effect of M on Y (path b).  This partial effect (a b) is said to mediate the direct effect of X &ndash;c&ndash;&gt; Y:     X &ndash;a -&gt;  M  &ndash;b&ndash;&gt; Y with X &ndash;c'&ndash;&gt; Y where c' = c - ab.
</p>
<p>Testing the significance of the ab mediation effect is done through bootstrapping many random resamples (with replacement) of the data.  
</p>
<p>For moderation, the moderation effect of Z on the relationship between X -&gt; Y is found by taking the (centered) product of X and Z and then adding this XZ term into the regression. By default, the data are zero centered before doing moderation (product terms).  This is following the advice of Cohen, Cohen, West and Aiken (2003).  However, to agree with the analyses reported in Hayes (2013) we can set the zero=FALSE option to not zero center the data.   
</p>
<p>To partial out variables, either define them in the z term, or express as negative entries in the formula mode:
</p>
<p>y1 ~ x1 + x2 + (m1)+ (m2) -z    will look for the effect of x1 and x2 on y, mediated through m1 and m2 after z is partialled out.  
</p>
<p>Moderated mediation is done by specifying a product term.
</p>
<p>y1 ~ x1 + x2*x3 + (m1)+ (m2) -z    will look for the effect of x1, x2, x3 and the product of x2 and x3 on y, mediated through m1 and m2 after z is partialled out.  
</p>
<p>In the case of being provided just a correlation matrix, the bootstrapped values are based upon bootstrapping from data matching the original covariance/correlation matrix with the addition of normal errors.  This allows us to test the mediation/moderation effect even if not given raw data.  Moderation can not be done with just correlation matrix.
</p>
<p>The function has been tested against some of the basic cases and examples in Hayes (2013) and the associated data sets.
</p>
<p>Unless there is a temporal component that allows one to directly distinguish causal paths (time does not reverse direction), interpreting mediation models is problematic. Some people find it useful to compare the differences between mediation models where the causal paths (arrows) are reversed.  This is a mistake  and should not be done (Thoemmes, 2015). 
</p>
<p>For fine tuning the size of the graphic output, xlim and ylim can be specified in the mediate.diagram function. Otherwise, the graphics produced by mediate and moderate use the default xlim and ylim values.
</p>
<p>Interaction terms (moderation) or mediated moderation can be specified as product terms.
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p> There are a number of other packages that do mediation analysis (e.g., sem and lavaan) and they are probably preferred for more complicated models.  This function is supplied for the more basic cases, with 1..k y variables, 1..n x variables,  1 ..j mediators and 1 ..z variables to partial. The number of moderated effects is not limited, but more than 3rd order interactions are not very meaningful.  It will not do two step mediation.
