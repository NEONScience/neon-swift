<h2> Climate of the East Coast of Australia </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of climate statistics for 16 coastal locations along Eastern
Australia. These sites were chosen to be approximately equally
spaced to cover the whole eastern coast of Australia.
For each site, climate statistics were calculated for the standard
30-year period 1971-2000. Only sites with nearly-complete data were
chosen.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(EastAuClimate)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following 10 variables and 5 items of metadata
for each of 16 sites.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>SummerMaxTemp</code></dt><dd><p> average daily maximum air
temperature (degrees C) in February. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SummerMinTemp</code></dt><dd><p> average daily minimum air
temperature (degrees C) in February. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>WinterMaxTemp</code></dt><dd><p> average daily maximum air
temperature (degrees C) in July. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>WinterMinTemp</code></dt><dd><p> average daily minimum air
temperature (degrees C) in July. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SummerRain</code></dt><dd><p> median total precipitation in February
(mm/month). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>WinterRain</code></dt><dd><p> median total precipitation in July
(mm/month). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MeanAnnRain</code></dt><dd><p> average total amount of precipitation
recorded in a year (mm/year). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>RainDays</code></dt><dd><p> average number of days in a year with at
least 1 mm of precipitation. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ClearDays</code></dt><dd><p> average number of clear days in a
year. This statistic is derived from cloud cover observations,
which are measured in oktas (eighths). A clear day is recorded
when the mean of the 9 am and 3 pm cloud observations is less than
or equal to 2 oktas. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>CloudyDays</code></dt><dd><p> average number of clear days in a
year. A cloudy day is recorded when the mean of the 9 am and 3 pm
cloud observations is greater than or equal to 6 oktas. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ID</code></dt><dd><p> BOM Site number. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Latitude</code></dt><dd><p> Site latitude (degrees North). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Longitude</code></dt><dd><p> Site longitude (degrees East). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Elevation</code></dt><dd><p> Site elevation (m). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>State</code></dt><dd><p> Australian state:
TAS = Tasmania, VIC = Victoria, NSW = New
South Wales, QLD = Queensland. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The row names of the data frame give the location names. Note: these
are not the official names of the climate stations.
