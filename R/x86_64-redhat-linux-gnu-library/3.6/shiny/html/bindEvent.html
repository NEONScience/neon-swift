<h2>Make an object respond only to specified reactive events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Modify an object to respond to &quot;event-like&quot; reactive inputs, values, and
expressions. <code>bindEvent()</code> can be used with reactive expressions, render
functions, and observers. The resulting object takes a reactive dependency on
the <code>...</code> arguments, and not on the original object's code. This can, for
example, be used to make an observer execute only when a button is pressed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
bindEvent(
  x,
  ...,
  ignoreNULL = TRUE,
  ignoreInit = FALSE,
  once = FALSE,
  label = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to wrap so that is triggered only when a the specified
event occurs.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more expressions that represents the event; this can be a
simple reactive value like <code>input$click</code>, a call to a reactive expression
like <code>dataset()</code>, or even a complex expression inside curly braces. If
there are multiple expressions in the <code>...</code>, then it will take a dependency
on all of them.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignoreNULL</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether the action should be triggered (or value
calculated) when the input is <code>NULL</code>. See Details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignoreInit</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, then, when the eventified object is first
created/initialized, don't trigger the action or (compute the value). The
default is <code>FALSE</code>. See Details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>once</code></td>
<td>
<p>Used only for observers. Whether this <code>observer</code> should be
immediately destroyed after the first time that the code in the observer is
run. This pattern is useful when you want to subscribe to a event that
should only happen once.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>A label for the observer or reactive, useful for debugging.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Shiny's reactive programming framework is primarily designed for calculated
values (reactive expressions) and side-effect-causing actions (observers)
that respond to <em>any</em> of their inputs changing. That's often what is
desired in Shiny apps, but not always: sometimes you want to wait for a
specific action to be taken from the user, like clicking an
<code><a href="actionButton.html">actionButton()</a></code>, before calculating an expression or taking an action. A
reactive value or expression that is used to trigger other calculations in
this way is called an <em>event</em>.
</p>
<p>These situations demand a more imperative, &quot;event handling&quot; style of
programming that is possible&ndash;but not particularly intuitive&ndash;using the
reactive programming primitives <code><a href="observe.html">observe()</a></code> and <code><a href="isolate.html">isolate()</a></code>. <code>bindEvent()</code>
provides a straightforward API for event handling that wraps <code>observe</code> and
<code>isolate</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>...</code> arguments are captured as expressions and combined into an
<strong>event expression</strong>. When this event expression is invalidated (when its
upstream reactive inputs change), that is an <strong>event</strong>, and it will cause
the original object's code to execute.
</p>
<p>Use <code>bindEvent()</code> with <code>observe()</code> whenever you want to <em>perform an action</em>
in response to an event. (Note that &quot;recalculate a value&quot; does not
generally count as performing an action &ndash; use <code><a href="reactive.html">reactive()</a></code> for that.) The
first argument is observer whose code should be executed whenever the event
occurs.
</p>
<p>Use <code>bindEvent()</code> with <code>reactive()</code> to create a <em>calculated value</em> that only
updates in response to an event. This is just like a normal <a href="reactive.html">reactive expression</a> except it ignores all the usual invalidations that
come from its reactive dependencies; it only invalidates in response to the
given event.
</p>
<p><code>bindEvent()</code> is often used with <code><a href="bindCache.html">bindCache()</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>ignoreNULL and ignoreInit</h3>

<p><code>bindEvent()</code> takes an <code>ignoreNULL</code> parameter that affects behavior when
the event expression evaluates to <code>NULL</code> (or in the special case of an
<code><a href="actionButton.html">actionButton()</a></code>, <code>0</code>). In these cases, if <code>ignoreNULL</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then it
will raise a silent <a href="validate.html">validation</a> error. This is useful behavior
if you don't want to do the action or calculation when your app first
starts, but wait for the user to initiate the action first (like a &quot;Submit&quot;
button); whereas <code>ignoreNULL=FALSE</code> is desirable if you want to initially
perform the action/calculation and just let the user re-initiate it (like a
&quot;Recalculate&quot; button).
</p>
<p><code>bindEvent()</code> also takes an <code>ignoreInit</code> argument. By default, reactive
expressions and observers will run on the first reactive flush after they
are created (except if, at that moment, the event expression evaluates to
<code>NULL</code> and <code>ignoreNULL</code> is <code>TRUE</code>). But when responding to a click of an
action button, it may often be useful to set <code>ignoreInit</code> to <code>TRUE</code>. For
example, if you're setting up an observer to respond to a dynamically
created button, then <code>ignoreInit = TRUE</code> will guarantee that the action
will only be triggered when the button is actually clicked, instead of also
being triggered when it is created/initialized. Similarly, if you're
setting up a reactive that responds to a dynamically created button used to
refresh some data (which is then returned by that <code>reactive</code>), then you
should use <code>reactive(...) %&gt;% bindEvent(..., ignoreInit = TRUE)</code> if you
want to let the user decide if/when they want to refresh the data (since,
depending on the app, this may be a computationally expensive operation).
</p>
<p>Even though <code>ignoreNULL</code> and <code>ignoreInit</code> can be used for similar purposes
they are independent from one another. Here's the result of combining
these:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ignoreNULL = TRUE</code> and <code>ignoreInit = FALSE</code></dt><dd>
<p>This is the default. This combination means that reactive/observer code
will run every time that event expression is not
<code>NULL</code>. If, at the time of creation, the event expression happens
to <em>not</em> be <code>NULL</code>, then the code runs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ignoreNULL = FALSE</code> and <code>ignoreInit = FALSE</code></dt><dd>
<p>This combination means that reactive/observer code will
run every time no matter what.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ignoreNULL = FALSE</code> and <code>ignoreInit = TRUE</code></dt><dd>
<p>This combination means that reactive/observer code will
<em>not</em> run at the time of creation (because <code>ignoreInit = TRUE</code>),
but it will run every other time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ignoreNULL = TRUE</code> and <code>ignoreInit = TRUE</code></dt><dd>
<p>This combination means that reactive/observer code will
<em>not</em> at the time of creation (because  <code>ignoreInit = TRUE</code>).
After that, the reactive/observer code will run every time that
the event expression is not <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Types of objects</h3>

<p><code>bindEvent()</code> can be used with reactive expressions, observers, and shiny
render functions.
</p>
<p>When <code>bindEvent()</code> is used with <code>reactive()</code>, it creates a new reactive
expression object.
</p>
<p>When <code>bindEvent()</code> is used with <code>observe()</code>, it alters the observer in
place. It can only be used with observers which have not yet executed.
</p>


<h3>Combining events and caching</h3>

<p>In many cases, it makes sense to use <code>bindEvent()</code> along with
<code>bindCache()</code>, because they each can reduce the amount of work done on the
server. For example, you could have <a href="sliderInput.html">sliderInput</a>s <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and a
<code>reactive()</code> that performs a time-consuming operation with those values.
Using <code>bindCache()</code> can speed things up, especially if there are multiple
users. But it might make sense to also not do the computation until the
user sets both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and then clicks on an <a href="actionButton.html">actionButton</a> named
<code>go</code>.
</p>
<p>To use both caching and events, the object should first be passed to
<code>bindCache()</code>, then <code>bindEvent()</code>. For example:<div class="NA"></p>
<pre>r &lt;- reactive({
   Sys.sleep(2)  # Pretend this is an expensive computation
   input$x * input$y
 }) %&gt;%
 bindCache(input$x, input$y) %&gt;%
 bindEvent(input$go)
</pre></div>
<p>Anything that consumes <code>r()</code> will take a reactive dependency on the event
expression given to <code>bindEvent()</code>, and not the cache key expression given to
<code>bindCache()</code>. In this case, it is just <code>input$go</code>.
