<h2>Lightning Fast Serialization of Data Frames for R.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multithreaded serialization of compressed data frames using the 'fst' format.
The 'fst' format allows for random access of stored data which can be compressed with the
LZ4 and ZSTD compressors.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The fst package is based on three C++ libraries:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>fstlib</strong>: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the <em>fst</em> format.
Written and owned by Mark Klik.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>LZ4</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
by Yann Collet.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>ZSTD</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.
</p>
</li></ul>
